  <p>Hi! I’m Laura. I’m from Phoenix, Arizona and am currently studying Marketing and Data Analytics. I love journaling, reading, crocheting and doing all sorts of crafty things. I also love spending time with my family and friends!</p>

  <p>I know I’ve already mentioned some of my hobbies, but I like a lot of things. Too many to list here, and I want to take a moment to write about a few more of my favorites. They aren’t exactly hobbies but more things I’m a fan of. I love Snoopy, Twilight (Team Edward), monkeys, the WNBA, movies (lots of movies), and trinkets. </p>

  <p>My list of dislikes is nowhere as long as my list of likes, but it does include being outside…</p>

  <p>As we approach the end of my brief introduction, I want to write a bit about my aspirations because they are an important part of who I am. Three of my biggest goals are to work in the WNBA (Go Phoenix Mercury!), to travel all over the world, and to live in the coolest place to ever exist, CDMX. </p>

  <p>Now, finally the reason why I’m here:

I have a long list of things I love and I also like to write about random things, so that’s why I’ve decided to create LMNOPages. I’ve been journaling for years so I want to use this page as an outlet for recording all of my thoughts and memories. If you’re reading this, welcome to my brain!</p>
