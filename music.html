      <h1>Music</h1>
      <p>
        Music has always been one of my favorite things. There’s literally a song for every mood,
        every season, every version of me. Whether I need comfort, motivation, or just some
        background noise while I journal or crochet, music always shows up. I love how it’s a timeless tool,
        songs from decades ago can still be equally impactful today. What we listen to says so much about
        who we are, and I think that’s what makes music so special.

        Amongst all the things that make me who I am, music is definitely one of the biggest. Here’s a
        playlist of some of my all-time favorite songs that I can listen to on repeat forever.
